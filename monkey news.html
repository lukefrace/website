    <b>Alright, bit of monkey news for ya</b><br >
    <p>
        There was this bloke who was a builder, right <br>
        And, er, you know what builders are like. They sort of move about, don�t they, from, from sort of building to building just building
        So he goes to his next job and that, right?
        He goes to, like, the boss of this building who�s building it
        Do you need anything building?
        So anyway, so he says, theres plent of work and that going about, were working on this here. get going on it like. Theres your bricks and your cement and stuff. get on with it
        They�re getting on with it and stuff. It�s all going well. But he notices that there�s someone working high up, on the top bit.
        Because you know how, like, there�s girders and stuff on these big buildings.
        well theres a little fella up there working harder than everyone else. 
        Turns out.<br>
